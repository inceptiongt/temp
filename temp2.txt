Several models of the RL10 engine have been produced to meet the requirements of specific vehicles and/or missions. The same basic engine cycle and operational modes are utilized for all models but each has installation and/or performance features which preclude complete interchangeability. Section 2 contains specifications for each of the developed models of the RL10 engine and pertinent features peculiar to each configuration. Specific differences in the component systems of each model are covered in other sections of this handbook. 1.2 Pratt & Whitney Aircraft March 1, 1966
