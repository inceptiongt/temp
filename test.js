00:00:45,837\nFor the very first time, we looked back at our own planet.\n\n8\n00:00:53,344 --> 00:00:58,683\nSince then, the human population has more than doubled.\n\n9\n00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:08,651\nThis series will celebrate the natural wonders that remain\n\n10\n00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:12,280\nand reveal what we must preserve\n\n11\n00:01:12,655 --> 00:01:16,785\nto ensure people and nature thrive.\n\n12\n00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:36,346\nImmense shoals of fish throng our shallow seas.\n\n13\n00:01:39,099 --> 00:01:40,558\nThese are anchovies.\n\n14\n00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,611\nSmall fish, in turn, sustain bigger ones.\n\n15\n00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,913\nHunters, such as giant trevally...\n\n16\n00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,463\nand mobula rays.\n\n17\n00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:20,056\nWhen hunters such as these work together, they become extremely efficient.\n\n18\n00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:07,353\nThe rich coastal seas are the fishing grounds of our planet\n\n19\n00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:13,276\nand can provide an abundance of food for wildlife and humanity.\n\n20\n00:03:27,665 --> 00:03:33,087\nThe seas fringing land make up less than a tenth of the world's oceans,\n\n21\n00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:39,469\nyet, astonishingly, 90 percent of all marine creatures\n\n22\n00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,055\nlive in these coastal waters.\n\n23\n00:03:46,476 --> 00:03:51,105\nThis superabundance is due to the fact that the seafloor here\n\n24\n00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,358\nis within reach of sunlight.\n\n25\n00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:04,244\nEverglades National Park in southern Florida.\n\n26\n00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:11,042\nFields of seagrass carpet the shallow tropical waters.\n\n27\n00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,635\nLike savannas on land,\n\n28\n00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:26,015\nthese lush marine meadows support a great variety of animal life.\n\n29\n00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:38,486\nStingrays search for prey hiding in the seagrass.\n\n30\n00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,922\nThe Everglades are also the hunting grounds\n\n31\n00:04:58,006 --> 00:05:01,009\nof the coasts' most ingenious fishermen.\n\n32\n00:05:01,092 -->

sonar.\n\n35\n00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,073\n[dolphins clicking]\n\n36\n00:05:39,464 --> 00:05:42,925\nAhead of them, a shoal of mullet.\n\n37\n00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:56,564\nThese particular dolphins\n\n38\n00:05:56,647 --> 00:06:00,151\nhave developed their own special way of catching their prey.\n\n39\n00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:10,536\nThey carefully herd the fish into just the right place.\n\n40\n00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:19,754\nThen one dolphin stirs up a ring of mud that encircles the shoal.\n\n41\n00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:28,221\nThe fish panic and take to the air.\n\n42\n00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:35,978\nMost escape.\n\n43\n00:06:37,438 --> 00:06:39,774\nCatching flying fish isn't easy.\n\n44\n00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,451\nBut the dolphins move on and take another helping.\n\n45\n00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:20,273\nPeople aren't allowed to fish commercially within the national park,\n\n46\n00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:24,527\nso there's plenty for the dolphins.\n\n47\n00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:43,671\nOnly from the air can we really appreciate the industry of these master fishermen.\n\n48\n00:07:53,848 --> 00:07:59,645\nThe shallow seas are vitally important in the fight against climate change.\n\n49\n00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:07,278\nSeagrass absorb 35 times as much carbon dioxide\n\n50\n00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:09,697\nas the same area of rainforest,\n\n51\n00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:15,578\nand that reduces the damage caused by the recent warming of our seas.\n\n52\n00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,835\nMangroves often border the seagrass meadows.\n\n53\n00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:28,799\nThese remarkable trees are the only ones that can cope\n\n54\n00:08:28,883 --> 00:08:32,011\nwith the varying saltiness of coastal waters.\n\n55\n00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:40,853\nThey not only protect our coasts from the destructive forces of hurricanes\n\n56\n00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:45,733\nbut also, like seagrass, capture carbon dioxide.\n\n57\n00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:58,120\nTheir tangled roots create safe nurseries for young fish,\n\n58\n00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,873\nwhich will eventually leave the mangroves\n\n59\n00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:05,711\nand make their homes in the tropical seas' most magical wonderlands,\n\n60\n00:09:07,171 --> 00:09:08,464\ncoral reefs.\n\n61\n00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:18,140\nThese reefs cover less than one percent of the seafloor,\n\n62\n00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:22,353\nyet they are home to a quarter of all marine species.\n\n63\n00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:33,573\nNone of these creatures would be here were it not for the coral.\n\n64\n00:09:45,751 --> 00:09:49,797\nCorals create the structures that provide food and shelter,\n\n65\n00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:52,633\non which the entire community depends.\n\n66\n00:09:58,889 --> 00:10:03,603\nEvery resident has a role to play in maintaining the health of the reef.\n\n67\n00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:12,737\nUnfortunately, few reefs are as pristine as they once were,\n\n68\n00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,658\nand most are now missing\n\n69\n00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:21,078\none extremely important member of the community.\n\n70\n00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:24,665\nSharks.\n\n71\n00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:34,216\nRelentless overfishing has reduced shark populations around the world\n\n72\n00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,218\nby over 90 percent.\n\n73\n00:10:39,972 --> 00:10:43,976\nToday they only thrive in anything like their former numbers\n\n74\n00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:46,479\non the very remotest of reefs.\n\n75\n00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:55,321\nFrench Polynesia, in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.\n\n76\n00:10:57,073 --> 00:11:00,201\nHere, at least, sharks are fully protected.\n\n77\n00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,086\nBy day, gray reef sharks hang in the current.\n\n78\n00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,969\nThey let little wrasse pick their teeth clean\n\n79\n00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,722\nin readiness for the night's hunt ahead.\n\n80\n00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:37,279\nThese sharks prefer to hunt in darkness,\n\n81\n00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:41,909\nwhen their acute senses give them an advantage over their prey.\n\n82\n00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:48,666\nNightfall.\n\n83\n00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:59,051\nTime for small fish to take refuge within the nooks and crannies of the reef,\n\n84\n00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,764\nbeyond the reach of the gray reef sharks.\n\n85\n00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,491\nThe sharks can detect the slightest movement.\n\n86\n00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:44,847\nBreaking cover is dangerous.\n\n87\n00:13:11,457 --> 00:13:15,419\nStay motionless and the sharks may not detect you.\n\n88\n00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:41,779\nA little fish may outmaneuver a single shark,\n\n89\n00:13:43,864 --> 00:13:48,202\nbut with so many hunters there is little chance of escape.\n\n90\n00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:01,757\nSheltering within the coral branches is usually the safest option,\n\n91\n00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:08,514\nbut the arrival of a second hunter changes everything.\n\n92\n00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,185\nWhitetip reef sharks.\n\n93\n00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,237\nSlender and more agile,\n\n94\n00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,783\nthe whitetips can get into hiding places other hunters can't reach.\n\n95\n00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:36,250\nThose that are not caught by the whitetips\n\n96\n00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:39,753\nare flushed out to the waiting gray reef sharks.\n\n97\n00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,389\nWith both kinds of sharks hunting in partnership,\n\n98\n00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:53,726\nthere is little respite, even within the reef.\n\n99\n00:15:14,371 --> 00:15:18,792\nMore and more sharks arrive, attracted by the commotion.\n\n100\n00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:04,380\nSuch numbers of sharks were once common on reefs around the world.\n\n101\n00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,552\nAnd while so many predators may seem damaging,\n\n102\n00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:16,225\nsharks, in fact, assist in maintaining the health of the reef.\n\n103\n00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,773\nThey help to keep a balance in the fish community\n\n104\n00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:27,778\nby hunting the predators that feed on small grazing fish.\n\n105\n00:16:35,577 --> 00:16:37,621\nThe grazers, in their turn,\n\n106\n00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,666\nkeep the corals free of seaweeds and parasites\n\n107\n00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:43,335\nthat would otherwise overgrow the reef.\n\n108\n00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:50,718\nA balanced community, with sharks as top predators,\n\n109\n00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:56,390\ngives a coral reef much greater resilience in the face of damage and disaster.\n\n110\n00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:04,857\nBut today, even healthy coral reefs are facing a greater threat.\n\n111\n00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:13,866\nWith climate change, our seas are warming.\n\n112\n00:17:17,870 --> 00:17:21,623\nMicroscopic plants that live within the tissues of the corals\n\n113\n00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,419\ngive them both their color and most of their nourishment.\n\n114\n00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:33,510\nBut if seas temperatures rise by just a degree or two,\n\n115\n00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:36,472\nthe corals expel their plant partners.\n\n116\n00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:46,899\nSo they lose their main source of food...\n\n117\n00:17:49,318 --> 00:17:50,444\nand turn white.\n\n118\n00:17:54,698 --> 00:17:58,911\nHere, on Australia's Great Barrier Reef, unusually warm seas\n\n119\n00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:02,331\nhave caused many of the reefs to bleach in this way.\n\n120\n00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,255\nIt may look hauntingly beautiful,\n\n121\n00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,842\nbut if temperatures remain high for a few weeks,\n\n122\n00:18:14,343 --> 00:18:18,347\nthe corals will starve and eventually die.\n\n123\n00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,104\nThe carbon dioxide that causes global warming\n\n124\n00:18:25,646 --> 00:18:28,065\nis also making the seas more acidic.\n\n125\n00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:31,944\nNo reefs can survive both changes.\n\n126\n00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,366\nAnd without living corals,\n\n127\n00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:41,078\nmany of the reef's residents will also perish.\n\n128\n00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,839\nDuring 2016 and 2017,\n\n129\n00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:56,260\nover a thousand kilometers of the Great Barrier Reef bleached.\n\n130\n00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,810\nSix months later,\n\n131\n00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,688\nand many of the corals are dead.\n\n132\n00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,401\nThe community destroyed.\n\n133\n00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:26,081\nWorldwide, half of all shallow coral reefs have already died.\n\n134\n00:19:30,669 --> 00:19:34,590\nThe rest could be gone over the next few decades.\n\n135\n00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:48,103\nAway from the tropics, in higher latitudes,\n\n136\n00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,105\nthe seas are much cooler.\n\n137\n00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:57,070\nStorm-lashed waters bring essential nutrients to the surface.\n\n138\n00:19:58,488 --> 00:20:02,117\nThe enriched water, combined with long summer days,\n\n139\n00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:05,871\nmake these the most productive seas on the planet.\n\n140\n00:20:15,339 --> 00:20:19,885\nFur seals thrive and even have time to ride the waves.\n\n141\n00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:49,790\nSpring off the coast of California\n\n142\n00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,795\nand fronds of golden kelp floating on the surface\n\n143\n00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,256\nhint at the riches hidden beneath.\n\n144\n00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,436\nA magnificent submarine forest.\n\n145\n00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:22,489\nThese stands of giant kelp are as important to the oceans\n\n146\n00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,449\nas trees are to the land.\n\n147\n00:21:31,248 --> 00:21:32,541\nLike a rainforest,\n\n148\n00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:37,671\nthe dense canopy provides food and shelter for an abundant community.\n\n149\n00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:50,934\nIn the cool, rich seas, giant kelp can grow 50 meters high.\n\n150\n00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:59,359\nAir-filled floats lift the fronds towards the sunlit surface.\n\n151\n00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,413\nNestling in this canopy,\n\n152\n00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:14,583\na sea otter.\n\n153\n00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,755\nHis thick fur keeps him warm in the chilly water.\n\n154\n00:22:28,221 --> 00:22:31,308\nBlowing air into it gives him extra insulation.\n\n155\n00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:45,280\nSea otters have the densest fur of any animal,\n\n156\n00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:50,410\nand such a luxuriant coat requires a great deal of attention.\n\n157\n00:23:20,107 --> 00:23:22,901\nThey need to eat a lot to keep warm\n\n158\n00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:26,488\nand consume up to a quarter of their body weight every day.\n\n159\n00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:35,705\nSea urchins are a favorite food.\n\n160\n00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:46,133\nThere's one.\n\n161\n00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:48,927\nAnd a second.\n\n162\n00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:56,393\nAnd then the otter is out of breath and must return to the surface.\n\n163\n00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,280\nAn urchin looks like a rather prickly meal,\n\n164\n00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:12,367\nbut if you can break the shell, there's a feast inside.\n\n165\n00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:26,715\nSea otters are crucial to the health of the kelp forest\n\n166\n00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:31,011\nbecause they keep down the number of sea urchins.\n\n167\n00:24:48,278 --> 00:24:50,030\nThe urchins graze on kelp,\n\n168\n00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:54,910\nmunching through their tough stems.\n\n169\n00:25:02,667 --> 00:25:07,464\nLeft unchecked, they spread across the seafloor like a plague.\n\n170\n00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:15,347\nFortunately, the otters have a helper in the fight against these spiny grazers.\n\n171\n00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,730\nSheephead wrasse.\n\n172\n00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,568\nThey have powerful teeth\n\n173\n00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:33,198\nand can make short work of the smaller purple urchins.\n\n174\n00:25:58,306 --> 00:26:01,017\nThe larger black urchins are more of a challenge,\n\n175\n00:26:03,103 --> 00:26:05,146\nespecially for smaller wrasse.\n\n176\n00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,529\nOnly the very largest sheephead can tackle them.\n\n177\n00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:29,129\nBut it still has to get past those long spines.\n\n178\n00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:39,097\nThe urchin has to be flipped over to expose its vulnerable underside.\n\n179\n00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:46,313\nNot easy when you have no hands.\n\n180\n00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,115\nSuccess at last.\n\n181\n00:27:00,869 --> 00:27:02,621\nAnd everybody benefits.\n\n182\n00:27:16,343 --> 00:27:20,639\nThese fish and otters, living within marine protected areas,\n\n183\n00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:23,183\nkeep the kelp grazers under control.\n\n184\n00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:34,736\nBut just outside these sanctuaries, the urchins graze unchecked...\n\n185\n00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,909\nand fell the kelp forest.\n\n186\n00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:49,751\nAll those that depend on the kelp have disappeared.\n\n187\n00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:03,139\nIn California, kelp forests grow abundantly in protected areas\n\n188\n00:28:03,223 --> 00:28:08,978\nwhere the whole marine community can live without pressure from people.\n\n189\n00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:25,704\nHere, at least, sea otters can chill out Californian style.\n\n190\n00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:41,177\n[bird caws]\n\n191\n00:28:45,014

hard winter,\n\n194\n00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:03,575\nthe first rays of the sun trigger a great annual event.\n\n195\n00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:15,086\nImmense shoals of herring rise up from the depths\n\n196\n00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,380\nand move into shallower waters.\n\n197\n00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,177\nThey're gathering to breed.\n\n198\n00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:28,641\nBut predators are waiting for them.\n\n199\n00:29:38,526 --> 00:29:40,612\nSteller's sea lions.\n\n200\n00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:54,918\nSo intent on their mission, the herring make easy prey.\n\n201\n00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:16,940\nSea lions drive the fish to the surface, within range of aerial hunters.\n\n202\n00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:28,535\nBald eagles, normally solitary birds, have assembled in numbers for the feast.\n\n203\n00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,586\nIn places, the herrings reach shore,\n\n204\n00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:44,509\nand there the eagles don't even need to take to the air.\n\n205\n00:31:14,163 --> 00:31:15,582\nHumpback whales.\n\n206\n00:31:16,249 --> 00:31:17,709\n[whale lows]\n\n207\n00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:24,632\nThey have come all the way from the tropics,\n\n208\n00:31:24,716 --> 00:31:27,260\nhoping to get their first meal in months.\n\n209\n00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:51,200\nThese whales have a remarkable way of collecting this seasonal bounty.\n\n210\n00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,430\nThey work as a team.\n\n211\n00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,516\nThe lead whale dives first...\n\n212\n00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:21,397\nand blows a curtain of bubbles to concentrate the fish.\n\n213\n00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,155\n[whale calling out]\n\n214\n00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,411\nA call synchronizes the attack.\n\n215\n00:32:35,495 --> 00:32:37,497\n[whale song increases in volume]\n\n216\n00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:28,089\nBy cooperating in this way, each whale can eat a ton of fish a day.\n\n217\n00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,928\nYet the herring are so abundant\n\n218\n00:33:34,512 --> 00:33:39,058\nthat, in spite of the whales, most managed to reach the shallows.\n\n219\n00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,354\nAnd here they spawn.\n\n220\n00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,282\nThe females lay their eggs on the seagrass.\n\n221\n00:33:59,662 --> 00:34:03,916\nThe males follow, fertilizing the eggs with clouds of sperm.\n\n222\n00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:16,095\nOnce, herring thrived here in an abundance we can barely imagine today.\n\n223\n00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:28,066\nThey used to turn shorelines white with spawn,\n\n224\n00:34:28,608 --> 00:34:32,987\nright across the North Pacific from Japan to California.\n\n225\n00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,162\nWith industrialized fishing techniques\n\n226\n00:34:41,746 --> 00:34:45,583\nit's all too easy to overexploit these breeding stocks.\n\n227\n00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:57,470\nThis is one of the few places where a fishery still survives.\n\n228\n00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:09,857\nPacific herring populations are greatly reduced.\n\n229\n00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:12,443\nA mere fraction of what they once were.\n\n230\n00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,833\nThis sorry tale of unsustainable fishing\n\n231\n00:35:26,916 --> 00:35:31,003\nhas been repeated time and again around the world.\n\n232\n00:35:35,591 --> 00:35:39,637\nMany of the world's fish stocks are now in serious decline.\n\n233\n00:35:41,556 --> 00:35:44,475\nA third of them have collapsed.\n\n234\n00:36:00,366 --> 00:36:02,243\nIn coastal seas,\n\n235\n00:36:02,326 --> 00:36:07,707\njellyfish are taking over waters that were once dominated by fish.\n\n236\n00:36:18,759 --> 00:36:21,762\nCompass jellyfish have an ethereal beauty,\n\n237\n00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:27,393\nbut they provide very little sustenance for other wildlife or us.\n\n238\n00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:51,876\nThese immense swarms are becoming increasingly common.\n\n239\n00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:57,298\nA worrying sign of a serious imbalance in our shallow seas.\n\n240\n00:37:08,434 --> 00:37:14,148\nUnless we start to fish sustainably, our seas, once so bountiful,\n\n241\n00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:22,073\nwill be filled with little more than vast swarms... of jellyfish.\n\n242\n00:37:39,131 --> 00:37:42,218\nBut the future does not have to be like this.\n\n243\n00:37:52,728 --> 00:37:58,359\nOn the Pacific coast of South America, we can see how the oceans can recover.\n\n244\n00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:06,867\nThe Atacama, the world's driest desert.\n\n245\n00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:12,081\nInland it's barely able to sustain life of any kind,\n\n246\n00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,463\nand yet the coast could not be more different.\n\n247\n00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:31,600\nFor centuries, seabirds have gathered in millions on these desert shores.\n\n248\n00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:41,277\nBut 50 years ago the great colonies disappeared\n\n249\n00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:44,322\nbecause we overfished the local waters.\n\n250\n00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:51,871\nControls were introduced , and now the fish stocks are recovering.\n\n251\n00:38:52,621 --> 00:38:59,128\nSo today, three million guanay cormorants assemble each year to raise their young.\n\n252\n00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,213\n[cawing]\n\n253\n00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:14,685\nEach morning the birds head out to sea.\n\n254\n00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:39,752\nThe colonies are so vast they take over an hour to empty.\n\n255\n00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:58,646\nJoining the procession, Inca terns.\n\n256\n00:40:06,862 --> 00:40:08,531\nPeruvian boobies.\n\n257\n00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:22,628\nA great caravan of hunters, all searching for the same thing.\n\n258\n00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:35,266\nAnchovies.\n\n259\n00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,528\nThese little fish are so abundant\n\n260\n00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:51,323\nthat they support the greatest fishery on our planet.\n\n261\n00:40:57,955 --> 00:41:01,959\nAstonishingly, they can account for a tenth of all the fish\n\n262\n00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:05,087\nwe harvest from our oceans every year.\n\n263\n00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:19,560\nSea lions are first to find the shoals.\n\n264\n00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:44,460\nAs fish are driven to the surface, they come within range of pelicans.\n\n265\n00:42:12,112 --> 00:42:14,990\nCormorants dive to grab their share.\n\n266\n00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:28,504\nBoobies strike from heights of 20 meters.\n\n267\n00:42:40,849 --> 00:42:44,103\nThey hit the water at a hundred kilometers an hour.\n\n268\n00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:29,481\nToday, the lives of five million cormorants and boobies\n\n269\n00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,900\ndepend on the great shoals.\n\n270\n00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:41,076\nYet, if we allow the anchovies to fully recover,\n\n271\n00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:45,914\nthey could sustain the 25 million seabirds they once did.\n\n272\n00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:54,256\nIt is a vivid reminder\n\n273\n00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:58,385\nof the astonishing riches our coastal seas can support.\n\n274\n00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:12,900\nAnd, when given the chance, they can recover surprisingly quickly.\n\n275\n00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:21,742\nThe islands of Raja Ampat in Southeast Asia.\n\n276\n00:44:23,744 --> 00:44:28,290\nThese seas were largely stripped of sharks and other large fish\n\n277\n00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:31,043\nby years of unregulated fishing.\n\n278\n00:44:35,422 --> 00:44:40,094\nThis lagoon was once occupied by a shark fishing camp.\n\n279\n00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:49,603\nNow it's a nursery for baby sharks.\n\n280\n00:44:56,026 --> 00:45:00,739\nThe seas around Misool were fully protected in 2007,\n\n281\n00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,992\nand the recovery has been miraculous.\n\n282\n00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:11,041\nToday there are 25 times more sharks than a decade ago.\n\n283\n00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:20,384\nTurtles that used to be hunted now peacefully graze on the seagrass.\n\n284\n00:45:33,105 --> 00:45:35,649\nSharks are returning to local reefs,\n\n285\n00:45:36,525 --> 00:45:39,236\nhelping to restore the balanced community,\n\n286\n00:45:39,820 --> 00:45:43,824\ngiving them a greater resilience against the effects of coral bleaching.\n\n287\n00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:06,472\nOcean-going manta rays.\n\n288\n00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:20,819\nSeven meters from wing tip to wing tip.\n\n289\n00:46:28,202 --> 00:46:30,329\nThese endangered giants\n\n290\n00:46:30,412 --> 00:46:33,665\nspend most of their lives roaming the high seas.\n\n291\n00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:39,880\nBut now they are returning to this sanctuary\n\n292\n00:46:39,963 --> 00:46:42,716\nto seek the attention of cleaner wrasse.\n\n293\n00:46:51,099 --> 00:46:57,689\nMisool is one of the few places on Earth where biodiversity is actually increasing.\n\n294\n00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:06,448\nSince protection, there are three times more fish\n\n295\n00:47:06,532 --> 00:47:08,200\nthan just ten years ago.\n\n296\n00:47:20,629 -->

far too few marine sanctuaries,\n\n299\n00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:49,449\nand in many commercial fishing is still allowed.\n\n300\n00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:58,250\nWe need to turn a third of all our
